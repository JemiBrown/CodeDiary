8.30.21 - Today is the start date for Culitvating Coders and I am excited to see what they will be teaching us. Working on more lessons on FCC. Signed up on Codepen, discord and worked on some business card on codepen. 

8.27.21 - Completed the CSS section on FCC. :heavy_check_mark:

8.26.21 - Worked on more CSS in FCC. 

8.25.21 - Worked on more CSS in FreeCodeCamp. :woman_technologist:

8.24.21 - Working through the first section in FreeCodeCamp. Currently in the CSS section. Gaining confidence. Aaron is going to look into learning JavaScript with me. Should be interesting. 

8.23.21 - Finally got back into my LinkedIn, Aaron, came into our group and had a power point for us with advice and tips. It was really cool and informative. "Don't Neglect your network" was the one line that we need to rememeber above anything else. Other advice was pick what you're good at and do it to pass on to someone else to do what you're not good at. Python will be a good code to learn. Put it on my short list. 

8.20.21 - I finished my HTML section on FreeCodecamp. Still locked out of LinkedIn. 

8.19.21 - Dabbled in some Javascript, Css and more HTML on Freecodecamp. Deven, Chris, and Alex came and spoke to our group and answered some questions for us. 

8.18.21 - Got set up with a few more resources and then was able to get back on freecodecamp and do a few more lessons. I'm catching on to it pretty nicely once I understand what is being asked of me. I'm not going to say that I am majorly confident, but I am not discouraged that this is something I wont be able to catch on to. Still keeping an open mind about what job position will be the best fit for me but I am getting more and more excited to see what we start doing when Cultivating Coders comes in to start teaching my group next week. 

8.17.21 - Signed up on LinkedIn, Meet up, and freeCodeCamp. Actually was able to start some coidng. Started the Responsive Web Design Certification model. Looking forward to just doing it on my own at home.
